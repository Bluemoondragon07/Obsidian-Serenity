# Serenity.
> There is nothing. Only you and the words. And your mind. In *sync*.
>> All you have to do is train your mind on the words. And write.

<br>

> Important Notice Regarding Network Fonts
> Since themes are no longer allowed to use assets over the network, Serenity's style settings for additional fonts no longer work out of the box.
> BUT...
> If you would like to restore these fonts, you can use [this snippet](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/Obsidian-Serenity/blob/main/0%20SNIPPET%20-%20Restore%20network%20font%20list) on your vault, and the fonts will work again.

This will have **Jim** show up as speech bubble title.
Images on the same line as the speech bubble are also supported.
